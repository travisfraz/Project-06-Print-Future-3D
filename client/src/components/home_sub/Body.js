                    Our Story: My name is Joey Lee, the designer and founder
                    of Print Future 3D. 
                    <br></br>
                    My fascination with additive manufacturing began back in 2011,
                    where I was first exposed to 3D printing as a freshman in
                    highschool. My interest began to expand into owning a small
                    business when I was being formally trained as a Mechanical 
                    Engineer at Iowa State University. Upon graduation from ISU 
                    in 2019, I moved to Des Moines IA and the time was right to 
                    found PF3D. Print Future was founded on July 4th, 2020 with 
                    the aim to positively impact the world of manufacturing by 
                    exploring and implementing new technologies for the betterment 
                    of humanity.
